## 👋 About Me  

I'm a **data scientist specializing in data storytelling, creative technologies, and experience design.**  
My work focuses on uncovering insights from crowdsourced data to better understand how people interact with technology, products, and services.

I began my career in the **Air Force** as an Airman Trainee, where I gained experience with radio communication systems and developed foundational skills in technology, discipline, and operational safety. Since then, I've earned an **MSc in Computing** from the **University of Reading (UK)** — awarded a **European Commission Erasmus Mundus Scholarship** — and an **MTech from the University of Trento (Italy)**, where I interned at the **Italian National Research Council (CNR)**.

I've worked at **IBM** and other global companies, developing data solutions for industries such as healthcare, banking, and e-commerce. As a **Project Scientist at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc)**, I designed and implemented **ontologies** to annotate large-scale Indian medical datasets, enhancing data analysis and integration.

My current research explores **geospatial and XR technologies**, **crowdsourced behavior analysis**, and **ontologies** to advance methodologies in **data science and storytelling**.  These approaches span domains like **cultural heritage** (heritage documentation and immersive storytelling) and **healthcare** (visual attention and sentiment analysis), with the goal of improving data science practices and enriching storytelling experiences.

### 🌍 NarrateAStory
**Role:** Founder & Data Storyteller  
**Links:** [🔗 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/debbdeb/NarrateAStory) · [📄 Publication (Primitive Tider)](https://journals.uio.no/PT/article/view/12093)

Created a **data storytelling and digital heritage platform** that fuses **ontology-driven analytics**, **geospatial mapping**, and **XR (extended reality)** technologies to document and visualize cultural heritage data through immersive narratives.

**Key Contributions**
- Developed a **semantic storytelling framework** integrating crowdsourced datasets and spatial metadata  
- Applied **knowledge graph modeling** to link heritage artifacts, stories, and locations  
- Designed **interactive visualizations** and immersive experiences for cultural documentation  
- Published research exploring the use of public data triples in collaborative heritage mapping  

**Keywords:** Data Storytelling · Ontologies · Geospatial Data · XR · Cultural Heritage · Knowledge Graphs
